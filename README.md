# Raycasting in C using Raylib

In this project I am trying to write a simple game/raycasting engine in C.
I took inspiration from [tsoding's](https://github.com/tsoding) raycasting [livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1xEkA46CuM&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZ08cYW6yqNTWLKqLssw0nm&ab_channel=TsodingDaily). As the main resource to help me learn how to implement the raycasting algorithm I used : [Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial
